### Setup
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(rvest)
library(readxl)
Player_Standard_Batting <- read_excel("~/Desktop/Player Standard Batting.xlsx")

```

### URL & xpath (Not working & Need to be fixed)
```{r}
# download.file(url = "https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2018-standard-pitching.shtml", destfile = "Batting")
# 
# XPATH <- '//*[@id="players_standard_batting"]'
# 
# DataTable <- readRDS("Batting")
# 
# web_page <- "https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2018-standard-pitching.shtml", destfile = "Batting"

```

```{r}
# Creating a new table (MLB) with variables that are necessary and significant & erasing rows that contain NAs.
MLB <- 
  Player_Standard_Batting %>%
  select(Name, Tm, Lg, Age, R, H, HR, RBI, AB, BA, POS) # POS should be included but could not be found..

str(Player_Standard_Batting)

# Average Hits and Batting aveage
MLB %>%
  summarise(BA = mean(BA, na.rm = TRUE) , H = mean(H, na.rm = TRUE)) # Pitchers Batting Average excluded 

# Most Hits and Batting aveage
MLB %>%
  filter(AB >= 300) %>%        # Filtering out players who were not at bat less than 300 games
  summarise(BA = max(BA, na.rm = TRUE), H = max(H, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Need to be improved
```{r}
# Counting the number of players who are 27 years old in each team & Removing pitchers and duplicated names from the data table occured due to trade during season.

MLB %>%
  group_by(Tm) %>%
  filter(Age >= 27) %>%
  filter(POS != "1") %>% # Pitchers have a number position = 1 / POS does not work 
  summarise(count = n( ))

```

## Relationship between age and single hits
```{r}
MLB %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= Age, y= H)) + 
  geom_density() +
  xlab("Age (yrs)") + ylab("Single Hits") +
  
```
